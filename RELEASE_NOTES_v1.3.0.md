## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### GUI Architecture Overhaul
**BEFORE v1.3.0 (Single Page):**
```python
# All content in one overwhelming page
def main():
    show_all_content_at_once()  # Difficult to navigate
```

**AFTER v1.3.0 (Tab-Based):**
```python
# Professional tab-based navigation
def main():
    tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4, tab5 = st.tabs([
        "🔧 Setup", "🔄 Migration", "📊 Results", 
        "⚡ Execute", "🔗 Connections"
    ])
```

### Safety System Enhancement
**BEFORE v1.3.0 (Basic):**
```python
# Simple button execution
if st.button("Execute"):
    execute_sql()  # Direct execution
```

**AFTER v1.3.0 (Multi-Level Safety):**
```python
# Progressive confirmation system
final_confirm = st.checkbox("🚨 I CONFIRM: Execute SQL against database")
if st.button("🚀 Execute SQL (DANGER)", disabled=not final_confirm):
    # Show final database details
    # Multiple safety checks
    execute_sql()
```

### Scrollable Container Implementation
**BEFORE v1.3.0 (Page Overflow):**
```python
# SQL content took entire page
st.code(sql_content, language='sql')  # No height limits
```

**AFTER v1.3.0 (Contained):**
```python
# Proper scrollable containers
st.markdown('<div class="sql-content-container" style="max-height: 400px;">', 
           unsafe_allow_html=True)
st.code(sql_content, language='sql')
st.markdown('</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
```
