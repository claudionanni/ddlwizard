This tool is not intended for migrating production environments because is subject to limitations of automatic tools.
A schema migration can determine dropping columns (if destination has extra columns compared to source) so that data will be lost,
it CANNOT automatically infer if a column just changed name.
It does not deal at all with data, just database objects.
A typical use case is for continous integration if you need to sync dev / stage environements where you can reimport data from source if needed.
It changes charsets, types, etc.
The application of the migration should be supervised to understand if it is safe for the specific case.
Rollback is also possible with limitations:
If a destination schema has a column with a unique index and migration dropped such column, when reverting with rollback the column and the unique index will be recreated,
nevertheless this operation will fail because the newly created column will have empty values.
